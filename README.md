## Terminal - Clockify

A little side project. A ruby script utilising clockify's APIs to use the web tool through terminal. 

A simple layout displaying entries. 

Limited functionality to Add, Stop, and look up past entries.

Looking to build upon the features as we learn how to integrate API's, MVC, Rails front end framework, SQL utilisation moving forward.
